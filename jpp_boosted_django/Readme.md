# Getting started  
In case you have no virtual environment installed yet, you have to create one and install the dependencies there
```
python3 -m venv env
```

Afterwards activate the environment
```
source env/bin/activate
```

Now you can install Django and Django REST framework into the virtual environment
```
pip install django
pip install djangorestframework
```

so you can run a command e.g. 
```
python manage.py runserver 
```
